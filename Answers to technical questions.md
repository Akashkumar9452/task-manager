# Answers to Technical Questions

## 1. How long did you spend on the coding test?

I spent approximately 2-3 hours on the coding test, broken down as follows:
- Initial project setup and dependency configuration: ~20 minutes
- Core components development (TaskForm, TaskList): ~1 hour
- Dashboard implementation and state management: ~45 minutes
- Styling, UI improvements, and testing: ~30 minutes
- Documentation and code cleanup: ~15 minutes

## 2. What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language?

In TypeScript 5.0 (the latest major version), one of the most useful features is the `const` type parameter modifier. This feature allows you to specify that a generic type parameter should be inferred as a literal type rather than a wider type. Here's an example from our task manager application:

```typescript
// Without const type parameter
function createTask<T extends string>(title: T) {
    return { title, id: crypto.randomUUID() };
}
const task = createTask("Buy groceries");
// task.title is inferred as string

// With const type parameter
function createTask<const T extends string>(title: T) {
    return { title, id: crypto.randomUUID() };
}
const task = createTask("Buy groceries");
// task.title is inferred as "Buy groceries" (literal type)
```

This feature is particularly useful when working with tuples and arrays where you want to preserve the literal types of the elements, which helps with type safety and autocompletion.

## 3. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?

Yes, I have experience tracking down performance issues in production. Here's my approach:

1. **Gather Data**:
   - Use performance monitoring tools (e.g., New Relic, Datadog)
   - Analyze browser performance metrics (Core Web Vitals)
   - Review error tracking systems (e.g., Sentry)
   - Check server logs for anomalies

2. **Identify Bottlenecks**:
   - Use Chrome DevTools Performance tab to record and analyze performance
   - Look for long-running JavaScript operations
   - Check for unnecessary re-renders using React DevTools
   - Analyze network waterfall charts for slow requests

3. **Common Areas to Check**:
   - Bundle size and code splitting
   - Memory leaks using Memory tab in DevTools
   - Database query performance
   - API response times
   - Asset optimization (images, fonts, etc.)

Real Example:
I once debugged a performance issue where a dashboard page was becoming increasingly slow over time. Using the Chrome DevTools Memory profiler, I discovered that we were not properly cleaning up event listeners in a React component, leading to a memory leak. The solution involved:

1. Taking heap snapshots to identify retained memory
2. Using the React DevTools to trace component updates
3. Implementing proper cleanup in useEffect hooks
4. Adding memoization for expensive calculations

## 4. If you had more time, what additional features or improvements would you add to the task management application?

1. **Technical Improvements**:
   - Implement proper error boundaries for better error handling
   - Add comprehensive unit and integration tests using Jest and React Testing Library
   - Implement optimistic updates for better UX
   - Add proper form validation with a library like Zod or Yup
   - Implement proper accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)

2. **Feature Enhancements**:
   - Task categories/tags with color coding
   - Subtasks support with progress tracking
   - Task templates for recurring tasks
   - File attachments for tasks
   - Task sharing and collaboration features
   - Email/push notifications for due dates
   - Task import/export functionality
   - Task statistics and productivity insights

3. **UX Improvements**:
   - Drag and drop interface for task reordering
   - Rich text editor for task descriptions
   - Dark mode support
   - Keyboard shortcuts for common actions
   - Customizable dashboard layout
   - Mobile-optimized interface with touch gestures
   - Offline support using Service Workers

4. **Integration Possibilities**:
   - Calendar integration (Google Calendar, Outlook)
   - Cloud storage integration for attachments
   - API integration with project management tools
   - Time tracking integration
   - Smart task suggestions based on user patterns
